        <ol>
            <li>Add butter, diced celery and carrots to a large stock pot
                 over medium-high heat. Saute for 3 minutes. Add garlic 
                 and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add chicken stock, seasoning the broth with rosemary,

                Add a spoonful of chicken bouillon to taste as needed.</li>
            <li>Bring broth to a boil. Add noodles and cook just 
                until noodles are al dente. </li>
            <li>Remove the pot from heat as soon as the noodles are barely tender.

            <li>Add the rotisserie chicken and make final additions of seasoning to taste. Enjoy!</li>
